In this project, a manipulator simulation demonstrates methods for rapid robot control implementation. The work accomplishes grasp and place missions in a virtual world using Gazebo and Robot Operating System (ROS).
The Matlab program is used to create the map for the robot's localization. Initializing variables, defining walls as a collection of points that form a closed polygon, and specifying a collection of waypoints (P) that the robot should go to the main functions of the MATLAB code. The robot's position (X, Y), orientation (th), and the left (X_l, Y_l) and right (X_r, Y_r) foot positions are all initialized.
